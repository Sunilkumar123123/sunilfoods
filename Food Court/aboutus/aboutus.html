        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support and energy. There are five main food groups, vegetables, fruits, grains, proteins, and dairy, and grains are mostly carbohydrates. There are subgroups of foods as well, such as added sugars, eggs, and more. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.
            
            Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Humans generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
